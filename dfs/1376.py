# A company has n employees with a unique ID for each employee from 0 to n - 1. The head of the company is 
# the one with headID.

# Each employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where manager[i] is the direct manager 
# of the i-th employee, manager[headID] = -1. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships 
# have a tree structure.

# The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. 
# He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on 
# until all employees know about the urgent news.

# The i-th employee needs informTime[i] minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates 
# (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

# Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.
